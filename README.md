How to use:

Start api by running api.py

You need to start a CORS anywhere instance on your machine for this to work properly

On this computer,  
    1. navigate to C:\Users\node_modules\cors-anywhere and run server.js
    2. Once this is runnning, you can use AJAX to make requests to the api by using the url, http://127.0.0.1:8080/*enter url here*
        This gets rid of the CORS warning that you will see if you do not use this format
